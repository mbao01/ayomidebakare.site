# Hey! I'm Ayomide 👋

I am a founder and software engineer. I am from [Nigeria 🇳🇬, West Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria). I studied Zoology in 2011 and dropped out after my first year to read Electronic and Electrical Engineering in 2012 in [Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU)](https://oauife.edu.ng/).

I started my career in software engineering late 2012 when I took on some [youtube videos by Bucky](https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston) on HTML, CSS, Javascript and Java. Thanks Bucky 🙏. With the compounded yet sneezy knowledge I had I was able to get into a robotics club by presenting a replica of OAU's website on localhost using [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/). From that moment, I realized that I can definitely build a career in software engineering, I was inspired.

Fast forward to 2018, 6 years after college (should be 5, thanks OAU) I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from OAU, I decided to become a founder full-time. I cofounded [InvenTech](https://inventech.ng), launched [Invent One](https://inventone.ng) and currently working on [ETrack](https://etrack.africa)

So far I have worked for [Mettalloids Limited](https://mettalloids.com), [Konga Online Shopping Limited](https://konga.com), [InvenTech](https://inventech.ng) and other ["Freelance jobs"](_ "Non existing").
